# **Customer Segmentation Using Python | Machine Learning Internship Project**

## **📌 Project Description**

This project focuses on customer segmentation using unsupervised machine learning techniques to group customers based on their purchasing behavior. The dataset includes customer details such as age, annual income, and spending score.
Using Python and K-Means clustering, customers are segmented into distinct groups that represent different spending patterns and income levels. The insights derived from this project can help businesses improve targeted marketing, customer retention, and revenue growth.

This project was completed as part of a Machine Learning / Data Analytics Internship and demonstrates the practical application of data science concepts to solve real-world business problems.
